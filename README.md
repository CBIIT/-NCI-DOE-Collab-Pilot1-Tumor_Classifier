# NCI-DOE-Collab-Pilot1-Tumor_Classifier

### Description:
The Tumor Classifier capability (TC1) shows how to train and use a neural network model model to classify tumor types from molecular features 
(e.g., RNASeq experssions) provided in Genomics Data Commons (GDC).

### User Community:	
Researchers interested in cancer susceptibility/histology; classification of diseases for oncology; cancer biology 


### Usability:	
The provided untrained model can be used by a data scientist. The provided scripts uses data that has been downloaded and normalized from GDC.

### Uniqueness:	
Using machine learning to classify molecular data have been comonly used. This capability shows how neural networks can be used in
classification of genomic profiles without downsampling the provided expressions.

### Components:	
* Processed training and test data
* Untrained neural network model
* Trained model weights and topoloty to be used in inference.

### Technical Details:
Please refer to this [README](./Pilot1/TC1/Readme.md)
